## 1.1 What Is Realistic Image Synthesis?

目的是使这些照片尽可能逼真，这样与真实照片的差异（如果虚拟场景将在现实中构建）不明显。
The aim is to make these pictures as photorealistic as possible, such that the difference with a real photograph (if the virtual scene would be constructed in reality) is not noticeable.

### 1.1.1 The Importance of Realistic Image Synthesis

#### Film and Visual Effects

#### Architecture

It is possible to make visualizations, whether they be still images or interactive walk-throughs, of buildings yet to be constructed. Not only can indoor illumination due to interior lighting be simulated, but outdoor lighting can be considered as well, e.g., the building can be illuminated using various atmospheric conditions at different times of the year, or even various times during the day.

#### Ergonomic Design of Buildings and Offices

#### Computer Games

#### Lighting Engineering

#### Predictive Simulations

#### Flight and Car Simulators

Aspects of street lighting are important in car simulators, accurate atmospheric visual simulation is important when designing a flight simulator
