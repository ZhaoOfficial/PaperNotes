   > Ditto. Because of interaction with lenses and samples.

5. Why does phase contrast require us to think of imaging electrons as waves?

# 3-2 Wave propagation and phase shifts

1. How is the scattering from an object converted into an image in a microscope?

2. What is the relationship between the density of the sample and the wave function present on the back focal plane of the objective lens? The image plane? Can you draw a picture showing why?

   > The back focal plane is the Fourier transform of the wave function. The electronic wave hit the sample and the decomposed by the lens to form the back focal plane, which is the way of Fourier transform. Then they synthesis again to form the image, which is the way of inverse Fourier transform. The image is a magnified replica of sample.
3. How are plane waves represented in an "Argand" diagram? What are the axes?

   > Real and imagine axes. The wave is represented as a vector. The length represents amplitude, the angle represents the phase.
4. Why were Argand diagrams introduced (how do they help us understand wave propagation and interference)?

5. How does the phase difference between two waves of identical frequency effect their interference?

   > Follow the rule of the vector sum. $\Delta\theta=0$, will enhance, $\Delta\theta=90$, small inference, $\Delta\theta=180$, will diminish.
6. What property of an electron wave gives the probability of its detection at each position?

   > CTF is a band pass filter.
   >

   > Domain: $[0, \infty)$.
   > Range: $[-1, 1]$.

4. What does a "contrast transfer" of 1.0 mean? -1? 0?

   > 1.0 means this frequency of wave adds all its amplitude to the amplitude of the unscattered wave.
   > -1.0 means this frequency of wave subtracts all its amplitude to the amplitude of the unscattered wave.
   > 0 means this frequency of wave has no contributes to the unscattered wave.

5. Why does the CTF oscillate sinusoidally?

   > Because the scattered wave in Argand diagram appears periodically, then with the effect of the contrast transfer, it oscillates sinusoidally.

6. What four variables appear in the argument of the sine function?

   > $$
   > \text{CTF}(\omega)=\sin(-\pi\cdot\Delta z\cdot\lambda\cdot\omega^2+\frac{\pi\cdot C\cdot\lambda^3\cdot\omega^4}{2})

   > The graph of the square of the CTF.

2. How can the defocus of a TEM image be determined?

   > The distance between predetermined image plane and focus. If the image form below the predetermined image plane, we call it defocused.

3. Why is defocus part of the argument of the CTF sine function?

   > It changes the optical path length, which changes the phase. So the CTF will be shifted. The more defocus, the higher frequency of the CTF sine function.

4. Does increasing the current in the objective lens make the image more or less defocussed?

   > Less defocused.

5. What is “over-focus”?

   > If the image form above the predetermined image plane, we call it over-focused.

6. How do heavily defocussed images look different than “closer-to-focus” images?

   > We can maximize the CTF value of the specified spatial frequency to get details.

7. What are the advantages of taking pictures far from focus? close to focus?
